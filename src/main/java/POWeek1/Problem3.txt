given:
PROCESSOR becomes D4F3C5C1E1S1S1E3C6
my answer:
QUADRANT becomes Q1G3A1B2C6A1B7J2

my logic:
Convert every letter to a number (A = 1, Z=26).
if the number is prime convert the number back into the letter it was  and add a 1 after it.
if the number is a perfect square takes its perfect square factors, put them side by side and turn the first number into a letter. (ex: D to B2, I to C3, P to D4, and Y to E5)
otherwise convert the number into its greatest and least factor. (18 to 2 and 9, 21 to 3 and 7)
if the letter was in an even position (0, 2, 4, 6) the lower number goes first in the ordering of the 2 numbers and become a letter again with the larger value going second.
if the letter was in an odd position (1, 3, 5) the larger factor goes first in the ordering of the 2 numbers and becomes a letter again with the lower factor going second.
